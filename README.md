Hi there, and welcome to my profile.

My name is Joseph Ogelenya, but I go by "Ojay", for short.
I am a computer science student, and a front end developer with aspirations of going fullstack in the nearest future.


My skills

I have knowledge and practice in building projects with the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- Javascript
- And much recently, React.
